Never buy an old car, buy a new one. Never buy a car if you cannot afford its fuel and repairs. Never buy a car if you do not have regular use of it. Uber and Ola are the better choice. Do not buy a car for appearances.

If you want to take a car, buy it without a loan or at least EMI. The plan to buy a car can be postponed for a few months so that maximum cash can be paid and EMI can be kept at a minimum. Buy a car at the festival time. Do not buy a car whose expenses are large, the more expensive the cost of repairing it and the more it will fall in value over time.

Apply the same rules at the time of buying or building a new house.

If your child is not very good at studies, then do not spend much money in his higher education, not at all. This is a complete waste of time and money.

Get health and life insurance, life can give sad moments at any time.

Make your children financially literate, not just schooling.

Never compete with your neighbor, friend or relative in terms of expenses.

Plan your retirement. Don't have to depend on your children after retirement.
