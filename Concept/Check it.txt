NoClassDefFoundError
	NoClassDefFoundError occurs when class was present during compile time and program was compiled and linked successfully but class was not present during runtime.
	It is error which is derived from LinkageError
	NoClassFoundError is the result of implicit loading of class because of calling a method or accessing a variable from that class
 Java program to illustrate
// NoClassDefFoundError
class GeeksForGeeks 
{
    void greeting()
    {
        System.out.println("hello!");
    }
}
  
class G4G {
    public static void main(String args[]) 
    {
        GeeksForGeeks geeks = new geeksForGeeks();
        geeks.greeting();
    }
}

Above program will be successfully compiled and generate two classes GeeksForGeeks.class and G4G.class .
Now remove GeeksForGeeks.class file and run G4G.class.
At Java runtime NoClassDefFoundError will be thrown.

ClassNotFoundException occurs when classpath is does not get updated with required JAR files while error occurs when required class definition is not present at runtime.
